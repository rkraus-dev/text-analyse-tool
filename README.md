# 🌐 Text Analysis Tool - ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/in%20progress-yellow)

A browser-based utility designed to provide real-time statistics for any given text. This project focuses on high accessibility standards, semantic HTML5 structure, and a mobile-first responsive design.

## 🛠 Technologies
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for better SEO and accessibility (using Main, Section, and Header tags).
* **WAI-ARIA:** Implementing ARIA roles and live regions for screen reader support.
* **CSS3:** (Planned) Custom properties and Flexbox for the layout.
* **JavaScript:** (Planned for February) Logic for word and character counting.

## 🚀 Features
* [ ] Real-time Word and Character counting.
* [ ] Estimated Reading Time calculation.
* [ ] Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
* [ ] Accessible interface (Screen reader friendly with `aria-live`).
* [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Reset via Accesskey).

## 🧠 The Process
This project is part of my **2026 Full Stack JS Roadmap**.
* **Step 1:** Designing a semantic HTML structure based on accessibility principles (WCAG/POUR).
* **Step 2:** Applying CSS for a modern, clean UI (Text Analysis Design).
* **Step 3:** Implementing JavaScript logic to handle text input and calculations.
